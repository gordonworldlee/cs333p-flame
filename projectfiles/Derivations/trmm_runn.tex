\section{Operation}

Considering the operation
\[
B := B U
\]
where $ U $ is a $ m \times m $ upper triangular matrix and $ B $ is a $ n \times m $ matrix.
This is a special case of  
matrix-matrix multiplication, 
with the {\sc u}pper triangular matrix on the {\sc r}ight, 
and the triangular matrix is {\sc n}ot transposed.
We will refer to this operation
as {\sc Trmm\_runn} where the {\sc runn} stands for
\underline{r}ight
\underline{u}pper
\underline{n}o-transpose
\underline{n}onunit diagonal.
The {\sc n}onunit diagonal means we will use the entries of the matrix that are stored on the diagonal.

\section{Precondition and Post-condition}

In the precondition 
\[
B = \widehat B
\]
$ \widehat B $ denotes the original contents of $ B $. It is implicitly assumed that $ U $ is the upper triangular of nonunit units.
This allows us to express the state upon completion, the post-condition, as
\[
B = \widehat B U .
\]
\section{Partitioned Matrix Expressions and Loop Invariants}

There are two PMEs for this operation.

\subsection{PME 1}

To derive the first PME, partition
\[
U \rightarrow
\left(\begin{array}{c I c}
	U_{TL} & U_{TR} \\ \whline
	0 & U_{BR}
\end{array}\right)
,
\quad \mbox{and} \quad
B \rightarrow \left(\begin{array}{c I c}
	B_L & B_R 
\end{array}\right)
\]
Substituting these into the postcondition
yields
\[
\quad
\left(\begin{array}{c I c}
	B_L & B_R 
\end{array}\right)
=
\left(\begin{array}{c I c}
	\widehat B_L & \widehat B_R 
\end{array}\right)
\left(\begin{array}{c I c}
	U_{TL} & U_{TR} \\ \whline
	* & U_{BR}
\end{array}\right)
\]
or, equivalently,
\[
\left(\begin{array}{c I c}
	B_L & B_R 
\end{array}\right)
=
\left(\begin{array}{c I c}
	\widehat B_L U_{TL} & \widehat B_L U_{TR} + \widehat B_R U_{BR} 
\end{array}\right)
\]
which we refer to as the first PME for this operations.

From this, we can choose two loop invariants:
\begin{description}
	\item
	{\bf Invariant 1:}
\begin{equation}
	\left(\begin{array}{c I c}
	B_L & B_R 
        \end{array}\right)
	= 
	\left(\begin{array}{c I c}
	\widehat B_L & \widehat B_L U_{TR} + \widehat B_R U_{BR} 
        \end{array}\right).	
\label{eq:inv1}
\end{equation}	
 \\
	(The left part has been left alone and the right part has been fully computed).
	\item
	{\bf Invariant 2:}
\begin{equation}
	\left(\begin{array}{c I c}
	B_L & B_R 
        \end{array}\right) = 
	\left(\begin{array}{c I c}
	\widehat B_L & \widehat B_R U_{BR} 
        \end{array}\right).
\label{eq:inv2}
	\end{equation} \\
	(The left part has been left alone and the right part has been partially computed).
\end{description}

\subsection{PME 2}

To derive the second PME, partition
\[
B \rightarrow \left(\begin{array}{c}
		B_T \\ \whline
		B_B
	\end{array}\right)
\]
and do not partition $ U $.
Substituting these into the postcondition
yields
\[
\left(\begin{array}{c}
    B_T \\ \whline
    B_B
\end{array}\right)
=
\left(\begin{array}{c}
    \widehat B_T \\ \whline
    \widehat B_B
\end{array}\right) 
U
\]
or, equivalently,
\[
\left(\begin{array}{c}
    B_T \\ \whline
    B_B
\end{array}\right)
=
\left(\begin{array}{c}
    \widehat B_T U \\ \whline
    \widehat B_B U
\end{array}\right) 
\]
which we refer to as the second PME.

From this, we can choose two more loop invariants:
\begin{description}
	\item
	{\bf Invariant 3:}

\begin{equation}
\left(\begin{array}{c}
    B_T \\ \whline
    B_B
\end{array}\right)
=
\left(\begin{array}{c}
    \widehat B_T U \\ \whline
    \widehat B_B
\end{array}\right) .
\label{eq:inv3}
\end{equation}
\\
	(The top part has been completely finished and the bottom part has been left untouched).
	\item
	{\bf Invariant 4:}
	
\begin{equation}
\left(\begin{array}{c}
    B_T \\ \whline
    B_B
\end{array}\right)
=
\left(\begin{array}{c}
    \widehat B_T  \\ \whline
    \widehat B_B U
\end{array}\right) ..
\label{eq:inv4}
\end{equation}\\
	(The bottom part has been completely finished and the top part has been left untouched).
\end{description}
